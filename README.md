# ESC204-DesignDossier
A collection of documents, which provide evidence for our design process, design outcomes, and collaboration process for the ESC204 Prototyping Skills Assignment.

Contents and Important Files:
-> 1 - Framing and Initial Ideas
    -> Material here is about the protective case. Iterative design for code/circuitry was started without initial framing
-> 2 - Code and Circuitry
    -> Includes final code (code_final.py) and circuitry (circuit_diagram_final.png)
    -> Code/breadboard layout iterations
    -> Calculations and design decisions described in resistor_calculations.rtf and update_log.rtf
-> 3 - CAD+CAM, MyFab Submission
    -> 
-> 4 - Testing
